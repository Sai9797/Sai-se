What is Java:

Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the mid-1990s. It is a class-based, object-oriented language that is designed to be portable and run on any platform, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere. Java is widely used for developing desktop applications, mobile apps, and web-based applications, as well as for building server-side applications and games.

why java:

Platform Independent: Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine, which eliminates the need for recompilation.

Object-Oriented: Java supports object-oriented programming, which allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.

Robust: Java has strong memory management and automatic exception handling, making it more reliable and less prone to crashes.

Secure: Java is designed to be secure, with built-in security features such as type-safe objects and automatic memory management.

Large Community: Java has a large, active developer community that provides ongoing support, development, and improvement to the language.

Versatile: Java can be used for a variety of applications, including web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications.

Scalable: Java can handle high-volume, high-performance applications by using multiple threads to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
